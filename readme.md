# 3D Fabrication for Physical Computing  <br/> Course Syllabus

**MTEC 2250  -3D Fabrication for Physical Computing Spring 2019**

## Description
A companion course to MTEC 2280, Ins and Outs, 3D Fabrication for Physical Computing is a project-oriented course that focuses on digital fabrication techniques in emerging media practices. Students deepen their knowledge of 3D design tools for use in CNC, laser cutters, 3D printers and printed circuit boards.

Students also explore and experiment with different materials available for the different fabrication machines.

## Instructor Notes
We will cover basic concepts of 3D modeling using Autodesk Fusion 360, in particular, focused on 3D printing and laser cutting. The course will be a combination of hands-on workshops, lecture, and in-class discussion.

Students are expected to spend at least 3-5 hours weekly outside of the scheduled time in class to complete assignments and advance projects. Midterm and Final Projects may require additional time, depending on your ambition. Budget more time each week that may be needed.

Each student is also responsible for maintaining a Github Repository, updating regularly to include process and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the prototyping process, from research to prototype
- Ability to sketch ideas on paper and through 3D modeling
- Ability to design for existing objects (fit, tolerances, measuring)
- Basic understanding of analog and digital fabrication techniques
- Design files for 3D printing and laser cutting
- Documenting your work
